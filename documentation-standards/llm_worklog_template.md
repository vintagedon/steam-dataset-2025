# üìã **Raw Config Worklog Template**

This template provides a standardized format for documenting the end-state configuration and key technical decisions from AI-human collaborative sessions. It serves as the technical artifact FROM which formal documentation will be written, eliminating the need to re-explain configurations across different AI sessions.

**STYLE GUIDE:** Focus on what works, not the journey. Document end-state configurations, key decisions, and working solutions. Avoid narrative storytelling - this is a technical reference artifact.

# üéØ **Template Structure**

## **Header Metadata**

Every worklog begins with a structured metadata table that provides essential project context and collaboration details.

```markdown
# **[Component/System] - As-Built - [Date]**

|  |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Project:** | [Project Name] |
| **Repository:** | [user/repo](https://github.com/user/repo) |
| **Author:** | [Your Name/Handle] |
| **AI Collaborator:** | [Claude Sonnet 4/Gemini Pro/etc] |
| **Status:** | [Active/Complete/Archived] |
| **Timeline:** | Total Time: ~[X] minutes across [Y] sessions.<br/>- [Phase 1]: ~[X] min<br/>- [Phase 2]: ~[X] min |
| **Next Documentation:** | [Link to or description of planned formal docs] |

### **AI/Human Collaboration**

[A brief, 1-3 sentence summary of the collaborative dynamic. Focus on roles and effectiveness.]
```

## **Core Sections**

### **Final Configuration**
The working end-state - commands, files, and settings that produce the desired outcome. This is the "as-built" instruction manual.

### **Key Technical Decisions**
Strategic architectural and implementation choices with concise rationale. Focus on why specific approaches were chosen.

### **Implementation Notes**
Working solutions for non-obvious challenges, performance considerations, and dependency requirements.

### **Known Issues & Workarounds**
Real problems encountered with working solutions. Focus on permanent fixes rather than temporary patches.

### **Validation/Testing**
Concrete steps to verify the configuration works correctly, including performance benchmarks where relevant.

  * **Hardware:** [Specific hardware requirements]
  * **Configuration:** [Environment or system configuration needs]

## **Known Issues & Workarounds**

* **Issue:** [Brief, clear description of a major issue encountered]
* **Solution:** [Description of the permanent fix or accepted workaround]

## **Validation/Testing**

* **Verification of Completion:** [Command or query that proves the process is complete]
  ```sql
  -- Example verification query
  [actual verification commands]
  ```
* **Performance benchmarks:** [specific metrics] on [hardware context]
* **Functional testing:** [steps to verify the system works as expected]

## **References**

* **Project Repository:** [https://github.com/user/repo](https://github.com/user/repo)
* **Internal:** [document-name.pdf] (v[X.Y], [date])
* **External:** [relevant external documentation or tools used]

# üõ†Ô∏è **Usage Guidelines**

## **When to Use This Template**

- **End of AI-human collaborative technical sessions**
- **After completing complex configuration or implementation work**
- **When documenting working solutions that will be referenced later**
- **Before transitioning to formal documentation writing**

## **When NOT to Use This Template**

- **During active development** (use this after reaching working state)
- **For simple, one-command configurations**
- **For exploratory research without concrete outcomes**
- **For general project planning or requirements gathering**

## **Content Principles**

### **Focus on End-State**
- ‚úÖ Document what works
- ‚ùå Narrate the debugging journey
- ‚úÖ Include final commands and configurations
- ‚ùå Explain every failed attempt

### **Technical Precision**
- ‚úÖ Use exact command syntax
- ‚úÖ Include specific version numbers
- ‚úÖ Provide copy-pasteable examples
- ‚úÖ Reference actual file names and paths

### **Concise Rationale**
- ‚úÖ "Decision: Used keyset pagination. Rationale: OFFSET unsafe on mutable datasets"
- ‚ùå Long explanations of all alternatives considered
- ‚úÖ Brief technical reasoning
- ‚ùå Marketing language or buzzwords

---

# üìö **Examples and References**

- Maintain numbering gaps (don't renumber)
- Focus on the essential working configuration

### **For Multi-Session Projects**
- Update timeline section with cumulative time
- Reference previous worklog sessions
- Document evolution of technical decisions

### **For Research Projects**

## üî¢ **CRITICAL: Semantic Section Numbering System**

**When USING this template:** If you omit sections, preserve the original numbering with gaps. Never renumber to close gaps.

- **Correct**: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 (Section 4 omitted, numbering preserved)
- **WRONG**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Renumbered - breaks RAG system optimization)

**This template structure:** Sequential numbering 1-6 with no gaps, designed for general use.

### **Content Guidelines**

- **No Manufacturing Documentation:** Include only sections that provide genuine value
- **Omit Empty Sections:** If a section would contain no meaningful content, remove it entirely
- **Focus on Technical Value:** Prioritize information that enables immediate action
- **Maintain Consistency:** Every section should serve a clear technical purpose
