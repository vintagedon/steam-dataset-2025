## ðŸ”¢ CRITICAL: Semantic Section Numbering System

When USING this template: If you omit sections, preserve the original numbering with gaps. Never renumber to close gaps.

- Correct: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 (Section 4 omitted, numbering preserved)
- WRONG: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (Renumbered - breaks RAG system optimization)

This template structure: Sequential numbering 1-6 with no gaps, designed for the general case.

### Template Usage Principles

- No Manufacturing Documentation: Include only sections that provide genuine value
- Omit Empty Sections: If a section would contain no meaningful content, remove it entirely
- Focus on User Needs: Prioritize information that helps data scientists and analysts succeed
- Maintain Quality Standards: Every section should serve a clear purpose and provide actionable information

### Content Guidelines

- All # and ## headings need introductory blurbs explaining what the section covers
- Tables in ### sections should have brief introductions explaining their purpose
- Avoid excessive heading depth - prefer flatter information architecture
- Keep mermaid diagrams simple - use KISS principle for accessibility across skill levels
- Link using current repo structure - reference repo-tree.txt for accurate paths

### Quality Indicators

- âœ… Document serves stated purpose clearly
- âœ… All major headings include explanatory context
- âœ… Examples are practical and tested
- âœ… Links reference actual repository structure  
- âœ… Length appropriate for content and audience
- âœ… No "manufactured" content filling template structure
- âœ… Accessible to wide range of skill levels
