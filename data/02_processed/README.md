# üî¨ Processed Data

Enriched and transformed Steam dataset with enhanced features, validation markers, and analytics-ready structure. This directory contains the refined output from data processing pipelines, featuring comprehensive validation, feature engineering, and structural enhancements that optimize the data for advanced analytics and machine learning applications.

## Overview

The processed data directory represents the culmination of systematic data transformation and enrichment processes applied to the raw Steam API collections. This data undergoes comprehensive validation, feature extraction, relationship mapping, and structural optimization to create analytics-ready datasets that support sophisticated analysis workflows while maintaining complete traceability to original sources.

The processing pipeline applies systematic quality assurance, extracts implicit features from JSON structures, validates data integrity, and prepares optimized formats for both relational database loading and direct analytical consumption. This approach enables advanced analytical applications while preserving data lineage and supporting reproducible research methodologies.
