# üìä Report Figures

Static visualization assets and publication-ready graphics supporting Steam Dataset 2025 analytical reports and academic publications. This directory will contain high-quality, publication-ready visualizations in multiple formats optimized for different presentation contexts including academic papers, web reports, and professional presentations.

## Overview

This directory is planned to house the complete collection of static visualizations and graphics assets that support the comprehensive analytical reporting framework. These figures will be optimized for different use cases, from high-resolution academic publication graphics to web-optimized versions for interactive reports. The visualization portfolio will demonstrate the analytical insights enabled by the multi-modal database architecture while maintaining professional presentation standards.

The figures will follow consistent styling and branding guidelines to ensure professional presentation across all contexts, with particular attention to accessibility, color-blind friendly palettes, and clear information hierarchy for complex analytical visualizations.
