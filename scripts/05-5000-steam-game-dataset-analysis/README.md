# üìä **Steam Dataset Analytics Framework**

Comprehensive analytics framework implementing sophisticated queries and automated report generation for Steam Dataset 2025 analysis. This directory contains the complete analytical infrastructure that demonstrates the advanced capabilities enabled by the multi-modal database architecture, including automated report generation, statistical analysis, and comprehensive data visualizations.

## **Overview**

This directory houses the production-ready analytics framework that represents the analytical culmination of the Steam Dataset 2025 project. The framework implements 16 sophisticated analytical queries covering market intelligence, content analysis, developer ecosystems, and pricing patterns. The system successfully scales from the 5K sample dataset to the complete Steam catalog (239K+ applications) while maintaining sub-second query performance for most analytical operations.

The analytics framework demonstrates practical applications of the PostgreSQL + pgvector architecture, showcasing semantic search capabilities, relationship network analysis, and comprehensive statistical profiling that would be impossible with traditional flat-file approaches.
