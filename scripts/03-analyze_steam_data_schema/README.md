# üîç Schema Analysis - Phase 3

Comprehensive analysis of Steam API data structure and PostgreSQL schema design, transforming collected sample data into actionable database architecture recommendations for the Steam Dataset 2025 project. This phase bridges the gap between raw data collection and practical database implementation through systematic field discovery and type inference.

## Overview

Phase 3 represents the critical analytical bridge between data collection and database design. Using the sample data collected in Phase 2, this phase employs recursive JSON traversal algorithms to systematically discover, catalog, and analyze every field present in Steam's complex nested data structures. The analysis produces detailed field statistics, data type distributions, and PostgreSQL schema recommendations optimized for the multi-modal database architecture outlined in the project's revised architectural plan.

This phase demonstrates sophisticated data engineering practices including automated schema inference, statistical field analysis, and database-specific type optimization. The comprehensive field analysis reveals the true complexity of Steam's API responses while providing actionable recommendations for efficient storage and querying patterns.

The work documented here transforms abstract JSON structures into concrete database architecture decisions, enabling informed choices about normalization strategies, JSONB usage patterns, and indexing approaches for the full-scale data collection and storage phases.

## Getting Started

For new users approaching schema analysis:

1. Prerequisites: Completion of Phase 2 with available JSON sample data
2. Analysis Execution: Run [analyze_steam_data_schema.py](analyze_steam_data_schema.py) on collected samples
3. Report Review: Study [field analysis report](steam-api-data-schema-analysis-report.md) for schema insights
4. Database Planning: Use recommendations for PostgreSQL schema design in Phase 4

## Analysis Methodology

This phase implements several sophisticated data analysis patterns:

### Recursive JSON Traversal

- Complete Field Discovery: Systematic traversal of all nested JSON structures
- Path Notation: Dot-notation field paths for clear hierarchical representation
- Array Handling: Special `[*]` notation for array element analysis
- Type Aggregation: Statistical collection of all observed data types per field

### Statistical Field Profiling

- Presence Analysis: Percentage of records containing each field
- Null Value Assessment: Non-null data percentage for data quality insights
- Type Distribution: Complete inventory of Python types observed per field
- Sample Collection: Representative examples for context and validation

### PostgreSQL Optimization Strategy

- Type Inference Logic: Intelligent mapping from Python types to optimal PostgreSQL types
- JSONB Recommendations: Strategic use of JSONB for nested structures
- Normalization Guidance: Field analysis supports normalization vs. denormalization decisions
- Performance Considerations: Type choices optimized for query performance and storage efficiency
