# 📊 Sample Data Collection - Phase 2

Systematic collection of representative Steam game data samples, implementing robust data gathering patterns and establishing collection parameters for the Steam Dataset 2025 project. This phase translates API testing insights into practical data collection methodology, generating structured samples for downstream schema analysis and validation.

## Overview

Phase 2 represents the practical application of API testing insights into systematic data collection methodology. Building on the validated API patterns from Phase 1, this phase implements resilient collection scripts that gather representative samples of Steam game data while handling the diverse content types, success patterns, and rate limiting constraints discovered during initial testing.

This phase demonstrates key data engineering principles including fault tolerance, periodic persistence, and comprehensive metadata tracking. The collection process targets actual games (filtering out DLC, soundtracks, and tools) while maintaining detailed audit trails of the collection process for downstream analysis and validation.

The work documented here establishes the foundational patterns that will scale to full dataset collection, proving the viability of the systematic approach through controlled sample generation.

## Getting Started

For new users approaching sample data collection:

1. Prerequisites: Ensure Phase 1 API testing completion and environment setup from [.env.example](.env.example)
2. Script Execution: Run [get_steam_data_sample.py](get_steam_data_sample.py) with desired sample size
3. Output Analysis: Review generated JSON files for data structure and quality
4. Performance Review: Examine [script-output.md](script-output.md) for collection efficiency metrics

## Collection Methodology

This phase implements several key data engineering patterns:

### Resilient Sampling Strategy

- Random Selection: Uses `random.choice()` on filtered candidate pool for unbiased sampling
- Continuous Processing: `while` loop ensures target count achievement despite failures
- AppID Filtering: Pre-filters catalog to AppIDs > 2000 to improve game hit rate
- Duplicate Prevention: Uses `Set` data structure for O(1) lookup performance on processed IDs

### Fault Tolerance Patterns

- Periodic Persistence: Saves progress every 25 processed applications to prevent data loss
- Graceful Degradation: Continues processing when individual API calls fail
- Comprehensive Logging: Structured logging provides visibility into collection behavior
- Error Context: Captures specific error conditions (401 Unauthorized, JSON decode failures)

### Data Quality Measures

- Type Validation: Only counts applications with `type == 'game'` toward target
- Success Verification: Validates both HTTP success and Steam API success flags
- Metadata Enrichment: Includes comprehensive collection metadata for data lineage
- Timezone Standardization: All timestamps stored in UTC for consistency

---

## Performance Metrics

From the documented collection run (100 games target):

### Collection Efficiency

- Target Achievement: 100/100 games successfully collected
- Processing Ratio: 193 total apps processed for 100 games (52% hit rate)
- Execution Time: 5 minutes, 12 seconds total runtime
- Throughput Rate: ~37 apps processed per minute (within API rate limits)

### Data Quality Results

- Success Rate: 100% of targeted games successfully captured with complete metadata
- Content Diversity: Mix of free/paid games, various genres, international titles
- Price Range: $0.89 - $59.99 with appropriate free game identification
- Metadata Completeness: All records include both Steam API data and collection timestamps

### Resilience Validation

- Zero Data Loss: Periodic saves prevented any collection progress loss
- Error Handling: Graceful handling of DLC, soundtracks, restricted content
- Rate Limit Compliance: 1.5-second delays maintained throughout collection
- Memory Efficiency: Streaming collection pattern prevents memory accumulation

## Technical Innovations

Several engineering patterns demonstrated in this phase:

### Hybrid Execution Modes

- Direct Mode: Command-line argument support for automation (`--count N`)
- Interactive Mode: User prompting for manual execution flexibility
- Default Behavior: Sensible defaults enable simple execution without parameters

### Dynamic Output Management

- Timestamped Files: Automatic filename generation prevents overwriting previous collections
- Descriptive Naming: Filenames encode collection parameters (`steam_data_100_games_20250831.json`)
- UTF-8 Handling: Explicit encoding ensures international content compatibility

### Professional Code Architecture

- Class-Based Design: Encapsulates state and behavior for reusability
- Type Hinting: Comprehensive type annotations for code clarity and IDE support
- Separation of Concerns: Distinct functions for data collection, saving, and UI interaction
- Comprehensive Comments: Detailed inline documentation explaining engineering decisions
