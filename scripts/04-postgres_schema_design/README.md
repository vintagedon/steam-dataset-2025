# 🗄️ PostgreSQL Schema Design & Database Pipeline

Complete PostgreSQL database implementation pipeline for Steam dataset with schema design, data validation, import processing, and initial analytics generation. This directory contains the comprehensive database infrastructure for transforming raw JSON data into a high-performance, analytics-ready relational database with vector search capabilities and optimized query performance.

## Overview

This directory implements the complete database pipeline for the Steam Dataset 2025 project, transforming JSON API responses into a sophisticated PostgreSQL database architecture. The pipeline includes systematic data validation, normalized schema design, efficient bulk import processes, and comprehensive analytics framework generation. The implementation leverages PostgreSQL 16 advanced features including JSONB support, vector extensions (pgvector), and HNSW indexing for semantic search capabilities.

The database design balances analytical performance with data integrity, supporting both traditional relational queries and modern machine learning applications through vector similarity search and comprehensive relationship modeling.

## Database Architecture Overview

### Schema Design Principles

The PostgreSQL schema implements a sophisticated normalized design optimized for both analytical performance and data integrity:

Normalized Entities: Separate tables for applications, developers, publishers, genres, and categories with proper foreign key relationships to eliminate redundancy and ensure consistency.

JSONB Preservation: Original API responses stored in JSONB columns alongside normalized data, supporting both structured queries and flexible JSON operations.

Vector Integration: pgvector extension support with 384-dimensional embedding columns for semantic search and machine learning applications.

Performance Optimization: Strategic indexing including HNSW indexes for vector similarity, B-tree indexes for common queries, and materialized views for complex analytics.

### Key Database Features

Multi-Modal Capabilities: Support for relational queries, JSON operations, and vector similarity search within a single coherent system.

Relationship Modeling: Complex many-to-many relationships properly modeled for developer/publisher networks, genre classifications, and content hierarchies.

Analytics Views: Pre-computed materialized views for common analytical queries with automatic refresh capabilities.

Extensibility: Schema design supports future enhancements including graph analysis integration and additional vector embedding types.

## Pipeline Implementation Details

### Data Validation (04-01)

Comprehensive validation ensures data quality before database loading:

Structure Validation: JSON schema compliance and required field presence verification across all input files.

Content Validation: Data type consistency, value range checking, and cross-field logical consistency validation.

Completeness Assessment: Missing data identification and completeness ratio calculation for quality assessment.

Error Reporting: Detailed validation reports with specific error locations and recommended resolution strategies.

### Schema Creation (04-02)

Systematic database schema deployment with comprehensive configuration:

Extension Setup: pgvector extension installation and configuration for vector similarity operations.

Permission Management: Database user creation and permission assignment for secure multi-user access.

Initial Configuration: Performance tuning parameters and connection pooling optimization.

### Bulk Import Pipeline (04-03)

High-performance data import with relationship mapping and validation:

Lookup Table Population: Developer, publisher, genre, and category entity tables populated with unique value extraction.

Application Import: Main application data import with foreign key relationship establishment and JSONB preservation.

Review Integration: User review data import with proper application relationship linking and user context preservation.

Transaction Management: Atomic import operations with rollback capability and comprehensive error handling.

### Performance Optimization (04-04)

Post-import optimization for analytical query performance:

Index Creation: Strategic B-tree and HNSW index creation for common query patterns and vector similarity operations.

Statistics Update: Database query planner statistics refresh for optimal execution plan generation.

View Materialization: Complex analytical view pre-computation with automated refresh scheduling.

Query Plan Optimization: Performance validation and query plan analysis for common analytical operations.

## Usage Instructions

### Environment Setup

1. Configuration: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure database credentials
2. Dependencies: Install required Python packages (psycopg2, pandas, numpy, pgvector)
3. Database: Ensure PostgreSQL 16+ instance with pgvector extension availability
4. Data: Verify processed JSON files are available in the data directory

### Pipeline Execution

Execute scripts in numerical order with proper dependency validation:

```bash
# 1. Validate input data integrity
python 04-01-validate-steam-data-integrity.py

# 2. Create database schema
python 04-02-setup-postgresql-schema.py

# 3. Import data with relationship mapping
python 04-03-import-json-to-pgsql.py

# 4. Optimize database performance
python 04-04-post-import-database-tasks.py database_name

# 5. Generate initial analytics
python 04-05-generate-initial-analytics.py database_name
```

### Customization Options

Schema Modifications: Edit `schema.sql` for custom table structures or additional indexes before running setup scripts.

Import Configuration: Modify import scripts for custom data transformations or additional validation requirements.

Analytics Customization: Extend analytics generation with custom queries and visualizations appropriate for specific analysis requirements.

Performance Tuning: Adjust indexing strategies and materialized view definitions based on specific query patterns and performance requirements.

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Standards

The pipeline implements comprehensive quality assurance at multiple levels:

Input Validation: JSON structure and content validation before any database operations begin.

Import Verification: Row count validation, foreign key integrity checking, and data type consistency verification during import.

Performance Validation: Query performance testing and index effectiveness measurement after optimization.

Analytics Validation: Statistical consistency checking and analytical result verification against known patterns.

### Error Handling

Systematic error handling ensures reliable pipeline execution:

Transaction Safety: Atomic operations with automatic rollback on failure to maintain database consistency.

Comprehensive Logging: Detailed operation logging with error context and diagnostic information for troubleshooting.

Recovery Procedures: Clear procedures for handling partial failures and resuming interrupted pipeline operations.

Validation Checkpoints: Multiple validation stages throughout the pipeline to catch errors early and minimize processing impact.
