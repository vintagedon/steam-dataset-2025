# ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Multi-Modal Schema Architecture

## 3.1 Relational Core Design

### Normalized Entity Framework

```sql
-- Primary application entity with hybrid column approach
CREATE TABLE applications (
    -- Relational columns for frequently queried fields
    appid BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(20) CHECK (type IN ('game', 'dlc', 'software', 'video', 'demo', 'music')),
    is_free BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    release_date DATE,
    metacritic_score INTEGER CHECK (metacritic_score BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
    
    -- JSONB columns for variable-structure data
    price_overview JSONB,
    pc_requirements JSONB,
    mac_requirements JSONB,
    linux_requirements JSONB,
    achievements JSONB,
    screenshots JSONB,
    movies JSONB,
    
    -- Vector columns for ML applications
    description_embedding vector(384),
    
    -- Metadata
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Normalized Lookup Architecture

```sql
-- Normalized entities with many-to-many relationships
CREATE TABLE developers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE publishers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE genres (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Junction tables for complex relationships
CREATE TABLE application_developers (
    appid BIGINT REFERENCES applications(appid) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    developer_id INTEGER REFERENCES developers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (appid, developer_id)
);
```

### Design Rationale

Hybrid Column Strategy Benefits:

- Frequently queried fields in normalized columns enable efficient indexing
- Variable-structure data in JSONB provides schema flexibility without performance penalties
- Vector columns support modern ML applications while maintaining relational integrity
- Balanced approach optimizing both transactional and analytical workloads

## 3.2 JSONB Integration Patterns

### Semi-Structured Data Architecture

```sql
-- JSONB structure examples with consistent schemas
price_overview JSONB: {
    "currency": "USD",
    "initial": 1999,
    "final": 1499, 
    "discount_percent": 25,
    "initial_formatted": "$19.99",
    "final_formatted": "$14.99"
}

pc_requirements JSONB: {
    "minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul>...</ul>",
    "recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul>...</ul>"
}

achievements JSONB: {
    "total": 50,
    "highlighted": [
        {"name": "Achievement Name", "path": "https://..."}
    ]
}
```

### JSONB Query Optimization

```sql
-- Efficient JSONB querying with proper indexing
-- GIN indexes for general JSONB queries
CREATE INDEX idx_price_overview ON applications USING GIN (price_overview);
CREATE INDEX idx_achievements ON applications USING GIN (achievements);

-- Expression indexes for frequent access patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_final_price ON applications 
    ((price_overview->>'final')::INTEGER) 
    WHERE price_overview IS NOT NULL;

-- Partial indexes for conditional queries
CREATE INDEX idx_paid_games_price ON applications 
    ((price_overview->>'final')::INTEGER) 
    WHERE is_free = FALSE AND price_overview IS NOT NULL;
```

### JSONB Best Practices

Schema Consistency Patterns:

- Maintain consistent key naming across similar JSONB documents
- Use typed extraction with casting for numerical operations
- Implement validation functions ensuring JSONB structure integrity
- Create materialized columns for frequently accessed JSONB paths

## 3.3 Vector Architecture for ML Integration

### Vector Column Design

```sql
-- Vector columns with appropriate dimensionality
ALTER TABLE applications ADD COLUMN description_embedding vector(384);
ALTER TABLE reviews ADD COLUMN review_embedding vector(384);

-- HNSW indexes for efficient similarity search
CREATE INDEX ON applications USING hnsw (description_embedding vector_cosine_ops) 
    WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
CREATE INDEX ON reviews USING hnsw (review_embedding vector_cosine_ops)
    WITH (m = 16, ef_construction = 64);
```

### Semantic Search Implementation

```sql
-- Vector similarity queries for recommendation systems
WITH similar_games AS (
    SELECT appid, name, 
           description_embedding <=> %s::vector AS distance
    FROM applications 
    WHERE description_embedding IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY description_embedding <=> %s::vector
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT * FROM similar_games WHERE distance < 0.3;
```

### Vector Performance Optimization

HNSW Index Configuration:

- `m = 16`: Balance between recall and index size for gaming data
- `ef_construction = 64`: Build quality vs construction time trade-off  
- `vector_cosine_ops`: Optimal operator for sentence transformer embeddings
- Regular `VACUUM` maintenance ensuring index performance

# üõ†Ô∏è 4. ETL Pipeline Architecture

## 4.1 Transactional ETL Framework

### Three-Phase Processing Pipeline

```python
class MultiModalETLPipeline:
    def __init__(self, db_config: dict):
        self.conn = psycopg2.connect(db_config)
        
    def execute_pipeline(self, source_data: List[Dict]):
        """Three-phase ETL with full transaction safety"""
        with self.conn.cursor() as cursor:
            try:
                # Phase 1: Populate lookup tables with conflict resolution
                self._populate_lookup_tables(cursor, source_data)
                
                # Phase 2: Generate referential integrity maps  
                lookup_maps = self._create_lookup_maps(cursor)
                
                # Phase 3: Insert main data with relationships
                self._insert_applications_and_relationships(cursor, source_data, lookup_maps)
                
                self.conn.commit()
                
            except Exception as e:
                self.conn.rollback()
                raise ETLException(f"Pipeline failed: {e}")
```

### Lookup Table Population with Conflict Resolution

```python
def _populate_lookup_tables(self, cursor, source_data: List[Dict]):
    """Bulk insert with conflict resolution for normalized entities"""
    # Extract unique entities from source data
    developers = set()
    publishers = set()
    genres = set()
    
    for record in source_data:
        app_details = record.get('app_details', {}).get('data', {})
        developers.update(app_details.get('developers', []))
        publishers.update(app_details.get('publishers', []))
        genres.update(g['description'] for g in app_details.get('genres', []))
    
    # Bulk insert with conflict resolution
    psycopg2.extras.execute_values(
        cursor,
        "INSERT INTO developers (name) VALUES %s ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING",
        [(name,) for name in developers]
    )
    
    # Similar patterns for publishers, genres, categories
```

### JSONB Data Transformation

```python
def _transform_jsonb_fields(self, app_data: dict) -> dict:
    """Transform and validate JSONB fields for database storage"""
    transformed = {}
    
    # Price overview transformation with validation
    price_data = app_data.get('price_overview')
    if price_data and self._validate_price_structure(price_data):
        transformed['price_overview'] = json.dumps(price_data)
    
    # Requirements transformation with HTML sanitization
    for req_type in ['pc_requirements', 'mac_requirements', 'linux_requirements']:
        req_data = app_data.get(req_type)
        if req_data:
            transformed[req_type] = json.dumps(self._sanitize_requirements(req_data))
    
    # Achievements with structure validation
    achievements = app_data.get('achievements')
    if achievements and self._validate_achievements_structure(achievements):
        transformed['achievements'] = json.dumps(achievements)
        
    return transformed
```

## 4.2 Performance Optimization Strategies

### Bulk Loading Patterns

```python
def _bulk_insert_applications(self, cursor, applications_data: List[tuple]):
    """Optimized bulk insertion using PostgreSQL COPY"""
    # Use COPY for maximum performance on large datasets
    copy_sql = """
        COPY applications (
            appid, name, type, is_free, release_date, metacritic_score,
            price_overview, pc_requirements, achievements, 
            created_at, updated_at
        ) FROM STDIN WITH CSV
    """
    
    # Convert data to CSV format in memory
    csv_buffer = io.StringIO()
    writer = csv.writer(csv_buffer)
    for row in applications_data:
        writer.writerow(row)
    
    csv_buffer.seek(0)
    cursor.copy_expert(copy_sql, csv_buffer)
```

### Memory Management for Large Datasets

```python
def process_large_dataset(self, data_file: Path, chunk_size: int = 1000):
    """Memory-efficient processing of large JSON datasets"""
    with open(data_file, 'r') as f:
        parser = ijson.items(f, 'games.item')
        
        chunk = []
        for record in parser:
            chunk.append(record)
            
            if len(chunk) >= chunk_size:
                self._process_chunk(chunk)
                chunk.clear()  # Free memory
                
        # Process remaining records
        if chunk:
            self._process_chunk(chunk)
```

# üìä 5. Performance Benchmarking and Optimization

## 5.1 Query Performance Analysis

### Analytical Query Patterns

```sql
-- Complex analytical queries with performance validation
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT 
    g.name as genre,
    COUNT(a.appid) as game_count,
    AVG(CAST(a.price_overview->>'final' AS NUMERIC) / 100.0) as avg_price,
    AVG(a.metacritic_score) as avg_rating
FROM applications a
JOIN application_genres ag ON a.appid = ag.appid  
JOIN genres g ON ag.genre_id = g.id
WHERE a.type = 'game' AND a.price_overview IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY g.name
HAVING COUNT(a.appid) >= 10
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC;
```

### Index Strategy Validation

```sql
-- Index usage analysis for optimization
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_tup_read,
    idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY idx_tup_read DESC;
```

## 5.2 Vector Search Performance

### Embedding Generation Pipeline

```python
def generate_embeddings_batch(self, texts: List[str], batch_size: int = 32):
    """Efficient embedding generation with batch processing"""
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    embeddings = []
    
    for i in range(0, len(texts), batch_size):
        batch = texts[i:i + batch_size]
        batch_embeddings = model.encode(batch, convert_to_numpy=True)
        embeddings.extend(batch_embeddings)
        
    return embeddings
```

### Vector Index Optimization

```sql
-- Vector query performance tuning
SET hnsw.ef_search = 100;  -- Higher search quality

-- Monitoring vector query performance
SELECT 
    query,
    mean_exec_time,
    calls,
    total_exec_time
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE query LIKE '%vector%' 
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC;
```

# üîß 6. Maintenance and Monitoring

## 6.1 Database Maintenance Procedures

### Automated Optimization Tasks

```python
def execute_maintenance_tasks(self):
    """Regular maintenance for optimal performance"""
    maintenance_sql = [
        # Update table statistics for query planner
        "VACUUM ANALYZE applications;",
        "VACUUM ANALYZE reviews;",
        
        # Refresh materialized views
        "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY developer_analytics;",
        "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY genre_analytics;",
        
        # Reindex vector indexes if needed
        "REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY applications_description_embedding_idx;"
    ]
    
    with self.conn.cursor() as cursor:
        for sql in maintenance_sql:
            cursor.execute(sql)
    self.conn.commit()
```

### Performance Monitoring

```sql
-- Database performance monitoring queries
SELECT 
    relname,
    n_tup_ins + n_tup_upd + n_tup_del as total_activity,
    n_live_tup,
    n_dead_tup,
    last_vacuum,
    last_analyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY total_activity DESC;
```

## 6.2 Quality Assurance Framework

### Data Integrity Validation

```python
def validate_database_integrity(self):
    """Comprehensive integrity checking"""
    checks = [
        # Referential integrity
        "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM application_developers ad LEFT JOIN applications a ON ad.appid = a.appid WHERE a.appid IS NULL",
        
        # JSONB structure validation  
        "SELECT appid FROM applications WHERE price_overview IS NOT NULL AND NOT (price_overview ? 'final')",
        
        # Vector column completeness
        "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM applications WHERE description_embedding IS NULL AND type = 'game'"
    ]
    
    issues = []
    with self.conn.cursor() as cursor:
        for check in checks:
            cursor.execute(check)
            result = cursor.fetchone()[0]
            if result > 0:
                issues.append(f"Integrity issue: {check} returned {result}")
                
    return issues
```
