# 📚 Methodologies

This directory contains the core methodologies and systematic approaches that underpin Steam Dataset 2025 development. These methodologies establish the technical frameworks, quality assurance procedures, and architectural patterns that enable reliable, scalable, and maintainable data engineering operations across the complete project lifecycle.

## Overview

The methodologies documented here represent battle-tested approaches developed through systematic AI-human collaboration using the RAVGV framework. Each methodology addresses specific technical challenges encountered in large-scale Steam API integration, multi-modal database implementation, and data quality assurance. These approaches are designed for reproducibility and adaptation across similar data engineering projects.
