# ‚ö†Ô∏è Steam Dataset 2025: Known Limitations & Data Constraints

This document provides comprehensive documentation of data collection limitations, API constraints, and known gaps in the Steam Dataset 2025. Academic transparency about these limitations is essential for proper interpretation and reproducible research practices.

---

# üéØ 1. Purpose & Scope

## 1.1 Purpose

This document ensures academic transparency by documenting all known limitations, data gaps, and collection constraints encountered during Steam Dataset 2025 development. It enables researchers to make informed decisions about dataset applicability and interpret results appropriately.

## 1.2 Scope

What's Covered:

- Steam Web API rate limits and failure patterns
- Missing application data and reconciliation efforts  
- Content type coverage and exclusions
- Geographic and regional data constraints
- Temporal limitations and data staleness

## 1.3 Target Audience

Primary Users: Academic researchers requiring transparent data provenance, peer reviewers evaluating dataset quality  
Secondary Users: Data scientists assessing dataset completeness, developers understanding API constraints  
Background Assumed: Understanding of API-based data collection challenges and academic research standards

## 1.4 Overview

The Steam Dataset 2025 achieves comprehensive coverage through official Steam Web APIs while acknowledging inherent limitations in API availability, content accessibility, and temporal data collection constraints. This documentation quantifies these limitations with specific metrics from the collection process.

# üìä 2. API Performance & Success Rates

This section documents empirically observed API performance patterns, success rates, and failure characteristics discovered during large-scale data collection.

## 2.1 Overall Collection Metrics

Comprehensive statistics from full dataset collection demonstrate API reliability patterns and identify primary failure sources.

### Primary Collection Results

| Metric | Value | Percentage | Notes |
|------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Total Applications in Steam Catalog | 263,890+ | 100% | From Steam app list API |
| Successful Data Collection | 239,152 | 90.6% | Applications with complete metadata |
| Failed API Calls | 24,738 | 9.4% | Various failure reasons documented below |
| Review Data Available | 119,804 | 50.1% | Games with at least some review data |

### API Success Rate Analysis

The 90.6% success rate for application metadata represents robust coverage while acknowledging systematic limitations in API access.

Success Rate Breakdown:

- Active Games: ~95% success rate for currently available content
- DLC Content: ~88% success rate due to dependency relationships  
- Legacy Content: ~75% success rate for older or discontinued items
- Regional Restrictions: ~60% success rate for geographically limited content

## 2.2 API Failure Categories

Detailed analysis of the 9.4% failure rate reveals distinct categories of unavailable content with different implications for research.

### Delisted Content (Primary Factor)

| Category | Count | Percentage of Failures | Description |
|--------------|-----------|---------------------------|------------------|
| Permanently Delisted | ~18,500 | 75% | Games removed from Steam store permanently |
| Regional Restrictions | ~3,200 | 13% | Content unavailable in collection region |
| Developer Removed | ~2,100 | 8.5% | Publisher/developer initiated removal |
| Licensing Issues | ~900 | 3.5% | Music, media licensing expiration |

### Technical API Failures

| Failure Type | Count | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Timeout Errors | ~1,200 | Temporary | Included in reconciliation efforts |
| Rate Limiting | 0 | None | Conservative 1.5s delays prevented |
| Server Errors (5xx) | ~300 | Minimal | Retry logic handled most cases |
| Malformed Responses | ~150 | Minor | Data validation caught issues |

## 2.3 Reconciliation & Backfill Results

Systematic efforts to recover missing data through targeted re-collection provide insights into permanent vs. temporary failures.

### Backfill Collection Analysis

```markdown
Initial Missing Applications: 2,493 (identified through review cross-reference)
Reconciliation Attempt: 2,493 targeted re-collections
Successful Recovery: 563 applications (22.6% success rate)
Permanent Failures: 1,930 applications (77.4% confirmed unavailable)
```

### Root Cause Analysis of Permanent Failures

The 77.4% permanent failure rate during backfill attempts confirms that most missing content represents genuinely delisted or restricted applications rather than temporary API issues.

Confirmed Delisted Categories:

- Discontinued Games: Early access projects abandoned by developers
- Legal Removals: Copyright disputes, trademark conflicts
- Publisher Consolidation: Games removed during company acquisitions
- Regional Exclusions: Content never available in US/European markets

# üåç 3. Geographic & Regional Constraints

This section documents how geographic location affects data collection completeness and introduces regional biases in the dataset.

## 3.1 Collection Region Impact

Data collection was performed from US-based infrastructure, introducing systematic biases toward Western content and English-language applications.

### Regional Availability Patterns

| Region | Estimated Coverage | Primary Limitations |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| North America | ~95% | Minimal restrictions |
| Europe | ~90% | Some country-specific exclusions |
| Asia-Pacific | ~75% | Significant regional restrictions |
| China | ~30% | Steam China separate platform |
| Other Regions | ~60% | Varying local regulations |

### Language Distribution Bias

The geographic collection point creates inherent bias toward English-language content and Western gaming preferences.

Observed Language Patterns:

- English: ~70% of successfully collected applications
- Multi-language: ~25% with English + other language support
- Non-English Only: ~5% (primarily Asian and European exclusives)

## 3.2 Pricing Data Limitations

Currency and pricing information reflects US market pricing, limiting applicability for global economic analysis.

### Currency Coverage

| Currency | Coverage | Accuracy | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| USD | 100% | High | Primary collection currency |
| EUR | ~85% | Good | European market pricing |
| GBP | ~80% | Good | UK market pricing |
| Regional Currencies | ~40% | Variable | Limited availability |

# ‚è∞ 4. Temporal & Data Freshness Constraints

This section documents time-sensitive limitations affecting data accuracy and research applications requiring current information.

## 4.1 Point-in-Time Collection

The dataset represents a snapshot collected during August-September 2025, with inherent limitations for longitudinal analysis.

### Data Collection Timeline

| Data Type | Collection Period | Staleness Risk | Update Frequency |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Game Metadata | Aug 31 - Sep 7, 2025 | Low | Relatively stable |
| Pricing Data | Aug 31 - Sep 7, 2025 | High | Changes daily |
| Review Counts | Aug 31 - Sep 7, 2025 | Medium | Grows continuously |
| Release Dates | Historical | None | Immutable |

### Temporal Analysis Limitations

Cannot Support:

- Real-time price monitoring or trend analysis
- Current player counts or concurrent user metrics
- Recent review sentiment changes
- New releases after September 2025

Suitable For:

- Historical game development trends
- Genre evolution analysis
- Developer/publisher relationship networks
- Cross-sectional analysis of Steam ecosystem

## 4.2 Review Data Temporal Constraints

Review collection represents a sample of available reviews at collection time, not comprehensive historical review data.

### Review Collection Methodology

| Parameter | Setting | Impact on Coverage |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Reviews per Game | 10 recent reviews | Misses older sentiment patterns |
| Language Filter | English priority | Excludes non-English reviews |
| Review Type | All purchase types | Includes free weekend reviews |
| Sort Order | Recent first | Temporal bias toward current opinions |
