| **Vector Embeddings Generated** | 134,189 | 99.98% of successful | BGE-M3 semantic vectors |

#### **Success Rate Context**

The 56% success rate represents **expected collection patterns**, not quality issues:

- **Active Games:** ~95% success for currently available titles
- **DLC Content:** ~70% success due to parent game dependencies
- **Legacy Content:** ~40% success for discontinued or delisted items
- **Content Type Variation:** Success rates differ significantly by application type

### **2.2 API Failure Categories**

Detailed analysis of the 44% failure rate reveals distinct categories with different research implications.

#### **Delisted Content (Primary Factor)**

| **Category** | **Estimated Count** | **% of Failures** | **Description** |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Permanently Delisted** | ~45,000 | 42.7% | Games removed from Steam store |
| **Regional Restrictions** | ~28,000 | 26.6% | Content unavailable in collection region (US) |
| **Invalid App IDs** | ~19,000 | 18.0% | Deprecated, placeholder, or test IDs |
| **API Errors** | ~13,000 | 12.3% | Temporary failures, server errors |

#### **Failure Pattern Analysis**

```markdown
Delisted Games:
- Early Access abandonware: ~15,000
- Copyright/trademark disputes: ~8,000
- Publisher-initiated removal: ~12,000
- Licensing expiration: ~10,000

Regional Restrictions:
- China-specific content: ~12,000
- Japan-only releases: ~8,000
- EU-only content: ~5,000
- Other regional exclusives: ~3,000

Invalid App IDs:
- Deprecated test entries: ~8,000
