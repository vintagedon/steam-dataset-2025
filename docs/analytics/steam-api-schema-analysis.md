## 3.4 JSONB Optimization Strategies

Strategic recommendations for handling complex nested data structures while maintaining query performance.

JSONB vs. Relational Trade-offs:

- Store as JSONB: Complex nested objects (ratings, requirements, package_groups)
- Extract to Columns: Frequently queried simple values (is_free, price_overview.final)
- Hybrid Approach: JSONB storage with materialized columns for common queries

Indexing Recommendations:

```sql
-- GIN indexes for JSONB containment queries
CREATE INDEX ON applications USING gin (app_details jsonb_path_ops);

-- Partial indexes for common filters
CREATE INDEX ON applications (is_free) WHERE is_free = true;

-- Expression indexes for JSONB value extraction
CREATE INDEX ON applications ((app_details->'data'->>'type'));
```

# 🛠️ 4. Usage & Maintenance

This section provides practical guidance for implementing and maintaining database schemas based on the Steam API analysis findings.

## 4.1 Usage Guidelines

Schema Implementation Best Practices:

- Primary Key Strategy: Use `appid` as BIGINT primary key for all application-related tables
- JSONB Performance: Store complex nested objects in JSONB columns with strategic indexing
- Field Extraction: Materialize frequently-accessed JSONB values into typed columns
- Null Handling: Account for field presence variations (many fields present in <50% of records)

Query Optimization Patterns:

```sql
-- Efficient JSONB querying with proper indexing
SELECT appid, name 
FROM applications 
WHERE app_details->'data'->>'type' = 'game'
AND (app_details->'data'->'price_overview'->>'final')::int < 2000;

-- Platform support detection
SELECT appid, name
FROM applications
WHERE app_details->'data'->'platforms'->>'windows' = 'true'
AND app_details->'data'->'pc_requirements' IS NOT NULL;
```

## 4.2 Schema Evolution Strategies

Field Addition Handling:

Steam API occasionally introduces new fields or modifies existing structures. The JSONB approach provides natural schema evolution capabilities:

- New fields automatically stored in JSONB without schema migration
- Popular new fields can be materialized to typed columns through ALTER TABLE
- Deprecated fields remain accessible in historical records

Data Type Flexibility:

Several fields show inconsistent typing across records (e.g., `required_age` as both int and str). JSONB storage preserves original type information while enabling application-level type coercion.

## 4.3 Monitoring & Validation

Data Quality Checks:

```sql
-- Validate field presence rates
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE app_details->'data'->'price_overview' IS NOT NULL) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as price_data_percent,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE app_details->'success' = 'true') * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as success_rate
FROM applications;

-- Monitor data type consistency
SELECT 
  jsonb_typeof(app_details->'data'->'required_age') as age_type,
  COUNT(*)
FROM applications 
WHERE app_details->'data'->'required_age' IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY jsonb_typeof(app_details->'data'->'required_age');
```
