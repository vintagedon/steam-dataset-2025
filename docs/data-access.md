# 📥 3. Download Procedures

This section provides step-by-step instructions for accessing currently available data and preparing for future full dataset access.

## 3.1 GitHub Sample Dataset Access

Immediate access to 5K sample dataset for evaluation and testing purposes.

### Method 1: Direct File Download

```bash
# Download specific files directly
wget https://github.com/VintageDon/steam-dataset-2025/raw/main/data/01_raw/steam_2025_5k-dataset-games_20250831.json.gz
wget https://github.com/VintageDon/steam-dataset-2025/raw/main/data/01_raw/steam_2025_5k-dataset-reviews_20250901.json.gz

# Decompress files
gunzip steam_2025_5k-dataset-games_20250831.json.gz
gunzip steam_2025_5k-dataset-reviews_20250901.json.gz
```

### Method 2: Repository Clone

```bash
# Clone complete repository
git clone https://github.com/VintageDon/steam-dataset-2025.git
cd steam-dataset-2025

# Navigate to data directory
cd data/01_raw

# Decompress sample files
gunzip *.gz
```

### Method 3: GitHub Release Downloads

Future GitHub releases will provide packaged sample datasets as zip archives for easier download.

## 3.2 Future Full Dataset Access (Zenodo)

Preparation steps for accessing the complete dataset upon Zenodo release.

### Zenodo Access Preparation

1. Monitor Repository: Watch GitHub repository for release announcements
2. Zenodo Registration: Create Zenodo account for download tracking (optional)
3. DOI Citation: Prepare citation templates using forthcoming DOI
4. Storage Planning: Ensure 5GB+ storage capacity for full dataset

### Expected Zenodo Package Structure

```markdown
steam-dataset-2025-v1.0.zip
├── data/
│   ├── steam_games_master.json           # 2.8GB - Complete games

# 🔍 5. File Specifications & Formats

This section provides detailed technical information about file formats, compression, and data structure to support proper data handling and processing.

## 5.1 File Format Details

All dataset files use standardized JSON format with optional gzip compression for efficient storage and transfer.

### JSON Structure Overview

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "collection_date": "2025-08-31T15:13:05Z",
    "total_records": 5000,
    "api_version": "steam_web_api_v1",
    "success_rate": "56%"
  },
  "games": [
    {
      "appid": 123456,
      "name": "Game Title",
      "app_details": { /* Complete Steam API response */ },
      "reviews": { /* Review data when available */ }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Compression Standards

- Algorithm: gzip compression (-9 maximum compression)
- File Extensions: `.json.gz` for compressed, `.json` for uncompressed  
- Tools: Compatible with gzip, 7-zip, WinRAR, and standard decompression utilities
- Size Reduction: Approximately 70-80% size reduction through compression

## 5.2 Data Quality & Completeness

Understanding data availability and success rates for proper analysis planning.

### Collection Success Rates

| Data Type | Success Rate | Coverage | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|-----------|
| Game Metadata | ~56% | Primary game information | API rate limits and regional restrictions |
| Reviews Data | ~45% | Player review content | Depends on game popularity and availability |
| Pricing Info | ~60% | Regional pricing data | Varies by market and currency |
| Media Assets | ~90% | Images and videos | Generally high availability |

### Quality Considerations

- Missing Data: Some applications may lack complete metadata due to Steam API limitations
- Regional Variations: Pricing and availability differ by geographic region
- Content Types: Includes games, DLC, software, videos, and demos with varying data completeness
- Update Frequency: Data represents point-in-time collection, not real-time values
