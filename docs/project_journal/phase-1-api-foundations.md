# Project Journal - Phase 1: API Foundations Development

Date: August 31, 2025 (Saturday morning)  
Phase Duration: ~3 hours  
Research Focus: Establish reliable Steam Web API integration and validate technical feasibility for large-scale data collection

---

## Research Objectives and Scope

### Primary Research Questions

- Can Steam Web API support sustained data collection for 260K+ applications?
- What are the optimal rate limiting parameters for production-scale collection?
- How can we ensure reliable data quality and error handling at scale?

### Methodology Approach

Systematic endpoint validation using controlled testing with professional development practices, establishing baseline performance metrics and sustainable collection parameters for subsequent phases.

---

## Technical Research Findings

### Steam API Landscape Analysis

Catalog Scale Discovery:

- Steam catalog enumeration: 263,901 total applications (significantly exceeding 2019 baseline of ~27K)
- Content diversity: Games, DLC, software, videos, music, and development tools
- API accessibility: 100% success rate on valid, active applications
- Response consistency: Sub-second latency with reliable JSON structure

Rate Limiting Behavior Analysis:

```python
# Optimal sustainable parameters discovered
DELAY_SECONDS = 1.5  # Conservative delay preventing throttling
ACHIEVED_THROUGHPUT = 40.9  # Requests per minute
SUCCESS_RATE = 100%  # On valid AppIDs with zero throttling errors
```

### Infrastructure Architecture Development

SteamAPITester Class Implementation:

- Persistent session management with connection pooling for efficiency
- Comprehensive error handling for network failures and malformed responses
- Professional logging framework supporting debugging and monitoring
- CLI interface with argparse enabling automation compatibility

Code Quality Standards Applied:
