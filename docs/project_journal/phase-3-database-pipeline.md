# Project Journal - Phase 3: Database Pipeline Implementation

Date: August 31 - September 2, 2025 (Saturday evening + Sunday + Monday)  
Phase Duration: ~8 hours total  
Research Focus: Implement production-grade multi-modal database architecture and validate comprehensive ETL pipeline with large-scale dataset deployment

---

## Research Objectives and Methodology

### Primary Research Questions

- Can a multi-modal database architecture effectively support both relational integrity and flexible semi-structured data requirements?
- How do we achieve production-scale performance while maintaining comprehensive data validation and quality assurance?
- What are the optimal patterns for vector embedding preparation in preparation for semantic search capabilities?

### Research Methodology

Systematic development of normalized PostgreSQL schema with JSONB integration, comprehensive ETL pipeline implementation with transaction safety, and validation through production deployment of complete 5K dataset with performance benchmarking.

---

## Database Architecture Research and Implementation

### Multi-Modal Schema Design

Core Architectural Innovation:

```sql
-- Normalized relational core with flexible JSONB integration
CREATE TABLE applications (
    appid BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(20),
    is_free BOOLEAN,
    -- JSONB columns for variable-structure data
    price_overview JSONB,
    pc_requirements JSONB,
    achievements JSONB,
    -- Vector columns for semantic search (384-dimensional)
    description_embedding vector(384)
);
```

Advanced Features Implementation:

- 12-table normalized schema balancing relational integrity with semi-structured flexibility
- Junction tables supporting complex many-to-many relationships (developers, publishers, genres)
- Vector columns prepared for pgvector semantic search and recommendation engines
- Materialized views optimizing analytical query performance

### ETL Pipeline Architecture Development

Transactional Processing Framework:

```python
# Three-phase ETL ensuring complete data integrity
def run_import(self, json_file):
    with self.conn.cursor() as cursor:
        # Phase 1: Populate lookup tables with conflict resolution
        self._populate_lookup_tables(cursor, lookup_data)
        # Phase 2: Generate referential integrity maps
        lookup_maps = self._fetch_lookup_maps(cursor)
        # Phase 3: Insert main data with junction table population
        self._insert_main_data(cursor, games, lookup_maps)
    self.conn.commit()  # All-or-nothing transaction
```

Production-Grade Pipeline Features:

- Comprehensive error handling with automatic transaction rollback
- Progress tracking and logging for extended processing operations
- Memory-efficient bulk operations supporting large dataset processing
- Resumable operations with state management and interruption recovery

## Data Collection and Enrichment Research

### 5K Dataset Processing Implementation

Comprehensive Data Pipeline:

- Extended Steam API collection to complete 5K game sample with full metadata
- Review data enrichment using secondary API key preventing rate limiting conflicts
- Data validation framework ensuring integrity throughout collection and processing
- Performance benchmarking on production PostgreSQL infrastructure

Reviews Collection Innovation:

```python
# Secondary API key strategy preventing rate limiting conflicts
STEAM_API_KEY_2 = os.getenv("STEAM_API_KEY_2")
# Separate collection process enabling parallel review enrichment
class ReviewEnricher:
    def __init__(self):
        self.api_client = ReviewAPIClient(api_key=STEAM_API_KEY_2)
```

### Data Quality Validation Framework

Comprehensive Integrity Assessment:

- Primary key uniqueness validation across 8,711 total applications
- Referential integrity verification for all foreign key relationships
- Business rule compliance checking (price ranges, ratings, temporal data)
- JSONB structure validation ensuring consistent semi-structured data organization
