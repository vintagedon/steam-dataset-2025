# 📂 **Phase 01: Dataset Foundations**

This phase documents the initial exploration of the Steam Web API, establishing the technical feasibility of collecting comprehensive gaming platform data. The session focused on understanding API structure, identifying rate limiting constraints, and validating that the Steam API provides sufficient data richness to support multi-modal database architecture with vector embeddings and graph analysis capabilities.

## **Overview**

Phase 01 represents the project's inception point where systematic API exploration revealed that Steam's official API could provide the data depth needed for advanced analytics. The session established conservative rate limiting parameters (1.5s delays achieving 17.3 requests/minute), documented the API's response structure, and confirmed availability of rich HTML descriptions suitable for NLP and embedding generation. These findings validated the feasibility of building a dataset significantly larger and more analytically capable than existing Steam datasets.

## **Phase Highlights**

### **Key Discoveries**

- **API Structure Validation**: Confirmed Steam Web API provides comprehensive game metadata including descriptions, pricing, platform support, and media assets
- **Rate Limiting Analysis**: Established sustainable rate of 17.3 requests/minute using 1.5-second delays with zero 429 errors
- **Data Richness Assessment**: Identified rich HTML descriptions suitable for NLP processing and vector embedding generation
- **Success Rate Patterns**: Documented ~56% API success rate due to delisted games, regional restrictions, and content type diversity

### **Technical Outcomes**

- Validated feasibility of collecting 240K+ applications from Steam catalog
- Established conservative rate limiting approach preventing API throttling
- Confirmed data structure supports planned multi-modal database architecture
- Identified need for JSONB storage to preserve complex nested structures
