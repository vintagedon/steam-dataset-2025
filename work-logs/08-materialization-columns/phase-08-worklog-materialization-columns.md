# Phase 8: Platform Support & Pricing Materialization Sprint

> **Session Date:** 2025-09-28  
> **Status:** Complete  
> **Scripts Produced:** 3 production Python scripts | 1 SQL validation suite  
> **Key Innovation:** Zero-discrepancy JSONB-to-relational migration with self-correcting validation loop

## Problem Statement

Key analytical fields (platform support, pricing data, achievement counts) were trapped within JSONB columns, making them slow to query, inaccessible to standard BI tools, and unusable for efficient filtering and aggregation. This architectural friction created a significant barrier to dataset usability for the target Kaggle audience who expect standard tabular data structures.

---

## Solution Overview

Implemented a complete Analyze → Schema Change → Populate → Validate workflow to materialize platform, pricing, and achievement metadata from JSONB sources into strongly-typed, indexed columns. The solution employed defensive population logic with business rule enforcement (excluding price data for free games) and achieved perfect validation: zero discrepancies across 239k+ records.

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Decisions

**Script-Driven Automation Over Manual SQL:** Encapsulated the entire workflow in Python scripts rather than raw SQL files. This provides automated execution, secure credential management via environment variables, repeatable runs with consistent logging, and robust error handling with graceful failures. The trade-off of increased complexity is justified by operational reliability for a production dataset pipeline.

**SQLAlchemy as Database Abstraction Layer:** Selected SQLAlchemy for database connectivity instead of raw psycopg2. SQLAlchemy provides standardized connection pooling, proper context management, and eliminates DBAPI2 compatibility warnings when integrating with Pandas. This is a best practice for production data engineering workflows that prioritizes maintainability over raw performance.

**Defensive Population with Business Rules:** Population logic explicitly validates source data presence (IS NOT NULL checks) and enforces business rules (is_free = FALSE for pricing). This conservative approach prevents casting errors from malformed JSON and ensures NULL in materialized columns unambiguously means "no source data available" rather than "processing error."

### Key Implementation Patterns

**RAVGV Methodology Application:** This session exemplified textbook RAVGV execution. Initial analysis revealed data patterns and potential issues. Schema verification occurred before population. Population was executed with progress monitoring. Comprehensive validation detected a business rule violation (free games with pricing data). Population logic was corrected and re-validated, achieving zero discrepancies. This iterative refinement demonstrates the methodology's power for quality assurance.

**Idempotent Operations Throughout:** Every script was designed for safe re-execution. Schema changes used `IF NOT EXISTS`. Population began with data clearing. Validation queries were read-only. This design pattern is critical for development workflows where scripts may need to run multiple times during debugging or schema iteration.

**Comprehensive Validation Architecture:** Validation wasn't a simple spot-check but a full-table source-to-destination comparison for every materialized column, plus logical consistency checks enforcing real-world constraints (no negative prices, valid discount logic, business rule compliance). This provides high-confidence, auditable proof of correctness suitable for academic dataset publication.

### Technical Innovations

**Self-Correcting ETL Pipeline:** The most significant innovation was the iterative feedback loop between population and validation. Initial validation correctly identified a data quality issue (13 free games with price_overview data). This finding was used to harden the business logic in the population script with the `AND is_free = FALSE` filter. The population script was re-run and re-validated to achieve perfect validation results. This demonstrates a mature, quality-driven data engineering workflow that catches and corrects issues systematically rather than ignoring edge cases.

### Running the Scripts

**Step 1: Pre-Materialization Analysis**

```bash
python3 00-data-analysis.py
```

Generates `./work-logs/phase-2-analysis-output.txt` with statistical profiles of source JSONB data patterns, quality metrics, and potential anomalies.

**Step 2: Schema Extension**

```bash
python3 01-add-materialized-columns.py
```

Adds 8 new materialized columns with inline documentation. Idempotent - safe to re-run. Verification report confirms successful DDL execution.

**Step 3: Data Population**

```bash
python3 02-populate-materialized-columns.py
```

Populates all materialized columns with progress checkpoints. Single transaction ensures atomicity. Takes ~1.5 minutes for full dataset.

**Step 4: Validation**

```bash
python3 03-validate-materialization.py
```

Comprehensive validation suite. Generates `./work-logs/phase-2-validation-results.txt`. Look for "✅ SUCCESS" in final summary.

### Verification

Check validation report for zero discrepancies:

```bash
cat ./work-logs/phase-2-validation-results.txt | grep -A 5 "VALIDATION SUMMARY"
```

Expected output should show 0 discrepancies and 0 violations across all checks, confirming perfect materialization accuracy.

## Lessons Learned

### Challenges Overcome

| Challenge | Root Cause | Solution | Technical Approach |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Script execution failures (PathingError, AttributeError) | Brittle absolute paths and incorrect datetime import | Reworked to relative paths (`./work-logs/`), corrected to `from datetime import datetime` | Path objects with `mkdir(exist_ok=True)`, explicit datetime class import |
| SQL GROUP BY errors in analysis | Missing non-aggregated columns in GROUP BY clause | Added all non-aggregated columns to GROUP BY | Standard SQL aggregation rules compliance |
| Logical violation (13 free games with prices) | Source data inconsistency where is_free flag didn't match price_overview presence | Added `AND is_free = FALSE` business rule filter to population UPDATE | Trust is_free as source of truth, exclude pricing for free games |
| Validation still flagging 13 discrepancies | Validation logic not aligned with corrected population logic | Added same `AND is_free = FALSE` filter to validation WHERE clauses | Ensure validation checks match population business rules exactly |

### Technical Insights

**JSONB Source Quality Requires Validation:** The Steam API source data, while high quality, contains logical inconsistencies (free games with price data). Validation must check not only data fidelity but also business rule adherence. Simply copying data is insufficient - defensive logic is required.

**Population and Validation Must Be Perfectly Aligned:** A change in business logic during population requires a corresponding change in validation. Misalignment creates false positives. The iterative refinement process revealed this coupling clearly.

**IS DISTINCT FROM is Critical for NULL Comparisons:** PostgreSQL's `IS DISTINCT FROM` operator correctly handles NULL-to-NULL comparisons, treating NULL as equal to NULL. Standard `!=` returns NULL when comparing NULLs, breaking validation logic. This is essential knowledge for source-to-target validation queries.

### Process Insights

**Iterative Analyze → Populate → Validate → Refine Loop Highly Effective:** The workflow of discovering issues through validation, refining business logic, and re-validating creates a self-correcting system that systematically improves data quality. This is superior to assuming correctness after a single pass.

**Scripted Automation Provides Significant Value:** Encapsulating each workflow step in a script with logging, error handling, and credential management provides repeatability and auditability impossible with manual SQL execution. The upfront investment in automation pays dividends in quality assurance.

**Progress Monitoring Critical for Long-Running Operations:** PostgreSQL DO blocks with RAISE NOTICE provide real-time progress feedback during multi-minute operations. This operational visibility is essential for production data pipelines.

### Reusable Components

- **SQLAlchemy Connection Pattern:** The standardized `create_engine` + context manager pattern with credentials from dotenv is reusable across all database scripts in the project
- **Idempotent DDL Pattern:** The `IF NOT EXISTS` + transactional execution pattern is reusable for all schema evolution scripts
- **Validation Query Architecture:** The structured suite of validation queries (discrepancy counts, logic checks, coverage reports) is a template applicable to any ETL pipeline validation
