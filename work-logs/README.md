# üìã Work Logs

Development work logs documenting systematic progress tracking and decision-making across all Steam Dataset 2025 project phases. This directory maintains a comprehensive record of the project development process, providing transparency into technical decisions, implementation challenges, and iterative refinement that leads to reliable data engineering outcomes.

## Overview

The work logs serve as the operational backbone of the Steam Dataset 2025 project's documentation strategy, capturing the real-time development process as it unfolds. Unlike traditional project documentation that focuses on outcomes, these logs document the journey itself - including challenges encountered, solutions developed, architectural decisions, and methodology evolution. They provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners interested in systematic approaches to complex data engineering projects.

This documentation approach demonstrates how structured development processes can produce reliable, high-quality data engineering outcomes while maintaining full transparency and accountability throughout the development lifecycle.

## üìÅ Directory Contents

This section provides systematic navigation to all work log entries, organized by development phase and chronological progression.

### Phase-Based Work Logs

| Work Log | Phase | Focus Area | Link |
|--------------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| [phase-1-foundations_worklog.md](phase-1-foundations_worklog.md) | Phase 1 | API exploration, infrastructure setup, methodology establishment | [phase-1-foundations_worklog.md](phase-1-foundations_worklog.md) |
| [phase-2-collection_worklog.md](phase-2-collection_worklog.md) | Phase 2 | Data collection, schema design, validation frameworks | [phase-2-collection_worklog.md](phase-2-collection_worklog.md) |
| [phase-3-pipeline_worklog.md](phase-3-pipeline_worklog.md) | Phase 3 | Database pipeline, enrichment processes, analytics foundation | [phase-3-pipeline_worklog.md](phase-3-pipeline_worklog.md) |

### Work Log Structure Pattern

Each work log follows a consistent structure optimized for both human readability and systematic knowledge capture:

- Session Documentation: Individual work sessions with timestamps, objectives, and outcomes
- Technical Discoveries: Key findings, architectural decisions, and implementation insights
- Implementation Notes: Detailed technical approaches and code development decisions
- Challenge Resolution: Obstacles encountered and systematic approaches to resolution
- Artifact Tracking: Documentation and code artifacts created during each session

## Work Log Methodology

### Documentation Principles

The work logs follow established principles for effective development documentation:

Systematic Recording: Each work session is documented with clear objectives, actions taken, and outcomes achieved. This creates a reliable audit trail for technical decisions and implementation approaches.

Challenge-Focused Narrative: Rather than simply listing completed tasks, work logs emphasize challenges encountered and systematic approaches to resolution. This provides valuable learning material for future similar projects.

Artifact Integration: All code, documentation, and technical artifacts created during development are explicitly referenced and linked, creating a complete picture of project evolution.

Decision Context: Technical decisions are documented with sufficient context to understand the reasoning, alternatives considered, and factors that influenced the final choice.

### Session Structure

Each work session within the logs follows a consistent pattern:

- Session Metadata: Date, duration, and primary objectives
- Technical Context: Current project state and specific focus areas
- Implementation Activities: Detailed account of technical work performed
- Discoveries and Insights: Key findings and technical learnings
- Artifacts Created: Documentation, code, and analysis outputs
- Next Steps: Clear direction for subsequent work sessions

### Quality Standards

Technical Accuracy: All technical information is validated and tested before documentation. Code examples are working implementations, not theoretical constructs.

Reproducibility: Work sessions are documented with sufficient detail to understand and potentially reproduce the technical approaches and decisions.

Transparency: Both successful implementations and failed approaches are documented, providing complete transparency into the development process.

Continuous Improvement: Work logs capture methodology evolution and process refinement, demonstrating systematic improvement in development approaches.
