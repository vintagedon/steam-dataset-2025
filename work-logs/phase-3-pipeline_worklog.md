## Overview

This comprehensive phase transformed collected sample data into a production-ready database infrastructure with advanced analytics capabilities. The session progressed from schema design through ETL implementation to successful deployment of a complete 5K dataset with validation and performance optimization.

Key Milestone Achieved: Production database with 8,711 applications and 36,265 reviews successfully deployed and validated, ready for advanced analytics.

Session Flow: Schema design → ETL pipeline development → 5K data collection → database deployment → performance optimization → analytics validation

## Technical Accomplishments

### Database Schema Implementation

Core Architecture Deployed:

```sql
-- 12-table normalized schema with advanced features
Applications (primary entity with JSONB columns)
Developers, Publishers, Genres, Categories (normalized lookups)
Application_* junction tables (many-to-many relationships)
Reviews (user review data with vector embedding support)
```

Advanced Features Enabled:

- JSONB columns for flexible semi-structured data (price_overview, system requirements)
- Vector columns (384-dimensional) prepared for pgvector semantic search
- Materialized views for analytics performance optimization
- HNSW indexes supporting vector similarity operations

### ETL Pipeline Development

Three-Phase Transactional Process:

1. Lookup Table Population: Bulk insert developers, publishers, genres, categories with conflict resolution
2. Main Data Import: Applications and reviews with comprehensive referential integrity
3. Junction Table Population: Many-to-many relationships with proper foreign key constraints

Production Pipeline Features:

```python
# Complete transaction safety implementation
with conn.cursor() as cursor:
    populate_lookup_tables(cursor, lookup_data)
    insert_main_data(cursor, games, lookup_maps)
    conn.commit()  # All-or-nothing transaction
```

### 5K Dataset Collection and Enrichment

Comprehensive Data Processing:

- Full Steam API collection extended to 5K games with complete metadata
- Review enrichment using secondary API key to avoid rate limiting conflicts
- Data validation with integrity checking and business rule verification
- Performance benchmarking on proj-pgsql01 infrastructure

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Design Strategy

Multi-Modal Database Architecture:

- Relational Core: Normalized schema for efficient queries and referential integrity
- JSONB Integration: Flexible storage for variable-structure data (system requirements, pricing)
- Vector Preparation: Pre-configured columns for semantic search and ML applications
- Performance Optimization: Strategic indexing and materialized views

Design Rationale: Balance query performance, data flexibility, and advanced analytics capabilities.

### ETL Pipeline Architecture

Transactional Design Principles:

- Single-transaction imports ensuring data consistency
- Lookup-first pattern preventing foreign key constraint violations
- Comprehensive error handling with automatic rollback on failures
- Progress tracking and logging for long-running operations

Scalability Considerations:

- Bulk operation patterns optimized for large datasets
- Memory-efficient processing preventing resource exhaustion
- Resumable operations supporting interruption recovery

### Reviews Data Strategy

Separation of Concerns:

- Primary API key for main game data collection
- Secondary API key for review enrichment preventing rate limit conflicts
- Separate collection scripts enabling parallel processing
- Independent validation and quality assurance workflows
