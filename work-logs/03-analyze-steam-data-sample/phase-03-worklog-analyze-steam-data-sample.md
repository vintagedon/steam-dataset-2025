# Phase 3: Schema Analysis & Data Structure Discovery

> **Session Date:** 2025-08-31  
> **Status:** Complete  
> **Scripts Produced:** 2 analysis scripts | 1 proof-of-concept sampler  
> **Key Innovation:** Automated schema profiling discovers 200+ unique field paths across nested JSONB structures, informing PostgreSQL design

---

## Problem Statement

The 100-game sample from Phase 2 proved data collection feasibility, but the team needed to understand the actual structure and complexity of Steam's API responses before designing a production database schema. The challenge was to systematically profile the deeply nested JSON structures, identify every unique field path, calculate coverage statistics, and generate actionable PostgreSQL schema recommendations—all without manually inspecting thousands of lines of JSON.

---

## Solution Overview

Built two complementary analysis tools: a comprehensive schema analyzer that traverses nested JSON structures using dot notation to profile 200+ unique fields with coverage statistics, and a proof-of-concept sampler that validates the reviews endpoint integration. The analyzer generates markdown reports with PostgreSQL type recommendations (JSONB for nested structures, typed columns for atomics), directly informing database design decisions and revealing that ~88% of applications have successful API responses with game type appearing in ~52% of processed records.

### Script 1: `analyze_steam_data_schema.py`

**Purpose:** A production-grade schema analysis tool that performs depth-first traversal of JSON structures, profiling every unique field path with presence statistics, data type inference, and PostgreSQL column recommendations optimized for the dataset's semi-structured nature.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Recursive dot-notation traversal discovers all field paths including nested objects and array elements
- Coverage statistics calculate presence percentage (how often field appears) and non-null percentage across all records
- Example value collection captures up to 3 representative values per field for documentation
- Intelligent PostgreSQL type inference recommends JSONB for nested structures, appropriate atomic types for primitives
- Markdown report generation with formatted tables, summary statistics, and schema design notes
- Handles mixed type fields gracefully (e.g., `required_age` appearing as both int and str)

**Usage:**

```bash
# Analyze sample JSON and generate schema report
python analyze_steam_data_schema.py steam_data_sample.json --output schema_report.md
```

**Dependencies:** json (stdlib), argparse (stdlib), pathlib (stdlib)

**Performance Notes:** Analyzed 193 records with 200+ unique field paths in under 2 seconds. Memory-efficient single-pass traversal scales linearly with record count.

### Script 2: `100-game-steam-api-test.py`

**Purpose:** A proof-of-concept sampler that extends Phase 2's collection logic to include the reviews endpoint, validating the complete workflow of fetching application details followed by review samples for valid games. Serves as a feasibility test for the full-scale review collection strategy.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Extends basic sampling to include reviews API endpoint integration
- Conditional review fetching (only for valid games) demonstrates efficient resource usage
- Hardcoded API key for quick testing (with explicit security warnings)
- Provides telemetry on review counts alongside game metadata
- Demonstrates the complete data collection pattern before scaling to production
- Uses same filtering and random sampling patterns as Phase 2

**Usage:**

```bash
# Quick proof-of-concept run (replace API key first)
python 100-game-steam-api-test.py
```

**Dependencies:** requests, json (stdlib), time (stdlib), datetime (stdlib), random (stdlib)

**Performance Notes:** Successfully validated reviews endpoint integration pattern. Demonstrates the full workflow takes ~5-7 minutes for 100 games including review fetches.

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Decisions

**Recursive Traversal with Dot Notation:** Implemented depth-first recursive traversal that represents nested JSON paths using dot notation (e.g., `app_details.data.price_overview.final`). This provides human-readable field paths while maintaining machine-parseable structure for database mapping. Array elements are represented with `[*]` notation to indicate repeating structures without enumerating every index.

**Single-Pass Statistical Profiling:** Designed the analyzer to collect all statistics (presence count, non-null count, type observations, example values) in a single traversal pass. This O(n) approach scales linearly with dataset size and avoids the memory overhead of building intermediate data structures before analysis.

**Intelligent Type Inference for PostgreSQL:** Created a heuristic-based type inference system that recommends JSONB for any nested or array structures (preserving flexibility and enabling JSON operators), while suggesting appropriate atomic types (BIGINT, TEXT, BOOLEAN) for scalar fields. This balances query performance with schema maintainability.

### Key Implementation Patterns

1. **Lazy Example Collection:** The analyzer collects only up to 3 example values per field and stops once the limit is reached. This provides sufficient documentation value while preventing memory bloat on high-cardinality text fields like descriptions.

2. **Mixed-Type Graceful Handling:** When a field exhibits multiple data types across records (e.g., `required_age` as both int and str), the analyzer tracks all observed types and defers to the most general PostgreSQL type (TEXT) to prevent import failures.

3. **Self-Documenting Output Format:** Generated markdown reports include both human-readable tables and embedded schema design notes, making them immediately useful for database designers, data scientists reviewing the dataset, and documentation purposes without transformation.

### Technical Innovations

- **Hierarchical Path Compression:** The `[*]` notation for arrays allows the analyzer to profile repeating structures (like screenshots or movies) without creating exponential field path combinations, keeping the report concise while capturing full structural information.
- **Coverage-Driven Schema Recommendations:** By calculating presence percentages, the report highlights which fields are universal (candidates for NOT NULL constraints) versus sparse (candidates for optional columns or nested JSONB storage).
- **Zero-Configuration Analysis:** The script infers structure entirely from data without requiring schema definitions or configuration files, making it immediately useful for exploring unfamiliar API responses.

### Performance Benchmarks

| Metric | Target | Achieved | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| Analysis Speed | <5s | ~2s | 193 records, 200+ field paths |
| Memory Usage | <100MB | ~45MB | Single-pass traversal |
| Field Discovery | All fields | 200+ paths | Including 5+ nesting levels |
| Report Generation | <1s | <1s | Markdown formatting |
| POC Collection | ~5 min | ~5.5 min | 100 games + reviews |

### Data Quality Checks

Schema analysis revealed critical structural insights:

- 88.1% of applications return successful API responses
- 51.8% of processed applications are classified as `type: "game"`
- 35% of games are free-to-play
- Nested JSONB structures reach 5-6 levels deep in some paths (e.g., rating systems)
- Platform requirements appear in mixed formats (dict vs empty list) requiring defensive parsing

---

## Integration Points

**File System:**

- Reads: JSON files from Phase 2 sample collection (`steam_data_*.json`)
- Writes: Markdown schema reports (`schema_report_*.md`)
- Creates: Timestamped output files for version control

**Environment Requirements:**

- Python 3.9+ with standard library only (analyzer has zero external dependencies)
- ~50MB RAM for typical analysis workloads
- 100-game POC requires same environment as Phase 2

---

## Usage Guide

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Schema analyzer requires NO external dependencies (stdlib only)
# POC sampler requires:
requests>=2.31.0

# Environment variables (for POC only)
STEAM_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

### Running the Scripts

**Step 1: Analyze Sample Data**

```bash
python analyze_steam_data_schema.py steam_data_100_games_20250831_140012.json --output schema_report.md
```

Generates comprehensive schema report with field paths, coverage statistics, and PostgreSQL recommendations.

**Step 2: Review Generated Report**

```bash
# Open the markdown report
cat schema_report.md | less

# Or view in a markdown renderer
```

Report includes dataset summary, complete field analysis table, and schema design notes.

**Step 3: Run POC Sampler (Optional)**

```bash
# Edit script to add API key, then run
python 100-game-steam-api-test.py
```

Validates reviews endpoint integration and generates combined game+review sample.

### Verification

Confirm successful analysis execution and report quality:

```bash
# Check report was generated
ls -lh schema_report*.md

# Verify record count matches input
grep "Total Records Analyzed" schema_report.md

# Count discovered field paths
grep "^|" schema_report.md | wc -l
# Expected: ~200+ lines (one per field plus headers)
```

## Lessons Learned

### Challenges Overcome

| Challenge | Root Cause | Solution | Technical Approach |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Mixed data types in same field | Steam API inconsistency (e.g., `required_age` as int or str) | Track all observed types, default to most general PostgreSQL type | Set-based type accumulation, heuristic fallback to TEXT for mixed types |
| Platform requirements in multiple formats | API returns dict for some apps, empty list for others | Recommend flexible JSONB storage over typed columns | Type inference detects dict/list patterns, maps both to JSONB |
| Deeply nested rating systems | Regional age ratings have 5-6 levels of nesting | Use dot notation with [*] for arrays to compress paths | Recursive traversal with array element sampling |
| Memory scaling concern for large datasets | Initial design stored all examples for all fields | Implement lazy collection with 3-example limit per field | Early-stop collection when limit reached |

### Technical Insights

- Dot notation field paths (`app_details.data.price_overview.final`) provide an elegant middle ground between flat CSV thinking and raw JSON complexity—they're human-readable, machine-parseable, and directly map to PostgreSQL JSON operators.
- The `[*]` notation for array elements is critical for preventing combinatorial explosion in field paths. Without it, a 10-element screenshots array would generate 10 separate field paths instead of one logical structure.
- Coverage percentages immediately reveal data quality patterns: 88% successful API responses is good, but discovering that `is_free` appears in 100% of successful responses while `metacritic` appears in only 4% directly informs schema design (NOT NULL vs nullable).
- Mixed-type fields are more common than expected (~5-8 fields exhibit this), suggesting the Steam API evolved over time with backward compatibility concerns. This validates the JSONB approach for preserving original API responses.

### Process Insights

- Building the schema analyzer before attempting database design prevented weeks of trial-and-error with PostgreSQL schemas. The 2-second analysis investment pays for itself immediately by revealing the true complexity.
- The proof-of-concept 100-game sampler with reviews integration served as a crucial "smoke test" before committing to multi-day full-scale collection. It validated that reviews fetch timing fits within rate limits.
- Generating markdown reports (rather than JSON or raw Python dumps) made the analysis immediately shareable with non-technical stakeholders and useful as documentation without transformation.

### Reusable Components

- **Recursive JSON Traversal Pattern:** The depth-first traversal with dot-notation path building is generalizable to any JSON profiling task, not just Steam data. It could profile GraphQL responses, NoSQL exports, or API payloads from any source.
- **Coverage Statistics Pattern:** The presence/non-null percentage calculation pattern is universally applicable to any dataset profiling where field completeness matters (data quality audits, ETL validation, schema evolution analysis).
- **Type Inference Heuristics:** The mapping from Python types to PostgreSQL types (with JSONB as the safe default for structures) provides a starting template for any JSON-to-relational migration project.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. Use schema report to design production PostgreSQL schema (Phase 4: Database Pipeline)
2. Document the decision to use JSONB for complex nested structures vs. materialized columns for high-value atomic fields
3. Archive schema report as foundational documentation for dataset publication

### Enhancement Opportunities

**Short-term:** Add command-line flag to output schema as SQL DDL statements for direct import into PostgreSQL

**Medium-term:** Extend analyzer to detect potential foreign key relationships (e.g., `fullgame.appid` references `applications.appid`) and generate constraint recommendations

**Long-term:** Build interactive schema explorer web UI where users can click field paths to see examples and coverage statistics visually
