# üìÅ **Phase 05: 5K Dataset Comprehensive Analysis**

This directory contains the work logs, analysis scripts, SQL queries, and generated reports from Phase 5 of the Steam Dataset 2025 project, which performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis on the 5,000-game sample dataset, establishing analytical methodologies and visualization standards for the full dataset.

## **Overview**

Phase 05 transformed the validated database from Phase 04 into actionable insights through systematic exploratory analysis. This phase developed the complete analytical framework including SQL query library, visualization generation pipeline, and automated reporting systems that were subsequently applied to the full 239K dataset. The analysis validated data quality, revealed market patterns, and demonstrated the dataset's analytical capabilities.

---

## **Technical Details**

### **SQL Query Architecture**

**Query Design Patterns:**

**Pattern 1: Genre Co-occurrence (Heatmap Data)**

```sql
WITH GameGenres AS (
    SELECT a.appid, g.name as genre_name
    FROM applications a
    JOIN application_genres ag ON a.appid = ag.appid
    JOIN genres g ON ag.genre_id = g.id
    WHERE a.type = 'game'
)
SELECT
    gg1.genre_name AS genre_a,
    gg2.genre_name AS genre_b,
    COUNT(*) AS co_occurrence_count
FROM GameGenres gg1
JOIN GameGenres gg2 ON gg1.appid = gg2.appid 
    AND gg1.genre_name < gg2.genre_name
GROUP BY gg1.genre_name, gg2.genre_name
ORDER BY co_occurrence_count DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Pattern 2: Temporal Analysis (Time Series)**

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM release_date) AS release_year,
    COUNT(*) AS game_count
FROM applications
WHERE type = 'game'
    AND release_date IS NOT NULL
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM release_date) BETWEEN 1997 AND 2025
GROUP BY release_year
ORDER BY release_year;
```

**Pattern 3: Distribution Analysis (Box Plot Data)**

```sql
WITH TopGenres AS (
    SELECT g.id
    FROM genres g
    JOIN application_genres ag ON g.id = ag.genre_id
    GROUP BY g.id
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT
    g.name AS genre,
    a.final_price / 100.0 AS final_price_dollars
FROM applications a
JOIN application_genres ag ON a.appid = ag.appid
JOIN genres g ON ag.genre_id = g.id
WHERE a.type = 'game'
    AND a.is_free = false
    AND a.final_price IS NOT NULL 
    AND a.final_price > 0
    AND g.id IN (SELECT id FROM TopGenres);
```

### **Visualization Pipeline**

**Chart Generation Process:**

```python
def generate_analysis_charts(query_results):
    """
    Automated visualization pipeline:
    1. Execute SQL query via pandas
    2. Apply data transformations
    3. Generate chart with matplotlib/seaborn
    4. Apply consistent styling
    5. Save to PNG with metadata
    """
```

**Styling Standards:**

```python
# Publication-quality settings
plt.figure(figsize=(19.20, 10.80))  # 1920x1080 pixels
plt.style.use('seaborn-v0_8-darkgrid')
plt.rcParams['font.size'] = 12
plt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 100

# Consistent color palette
colors = ['#1f77b4', '#ff7f0e', '#2ca02c', '#d62728', ...]
```

**Chart Types Utilized:**

- **Heatmaps:** Genre co-occurrence patterns
- **Horizontal Bar Charts:** Rankings and comparisons
- **Histograms:** Distribution analysis
- **Box Plots:** Price and metric distributions
- **Scatter Plots:** Correlation analysis
- **Line Charts:** Temporal trends

## **Data Quality Validation**

### **Analysis-Driven Quality Checks**

**Completeness Validation:**

```sql
-- Sample completeness query
SELECT 
    'Total Applications' AS metric,
    COUNT(*) AS count,
    '100%' AS coverage
FROM applications
UNION ALL
SELECT 
    'With Pricing Data',
    COUNT(*),
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM applications), 1) || '%'
FROM applications 
WHERE initial_price IS NOT NULL;
```

**Results:**

- Core metadata: 100% (by definition)
- Pricing data: 55.4% (expected for F2P + delisted games)
- Genre data: 88.6%
- Release dates: 88.1%
- Screenshots: 85.1%
- Metacritic: 4.1% (expected - critics review subset)

**Anomaly Detection:**

```sql
-- Detect pricing anomalies
SELECT appid, name, initial_price, final_price, discount_percent
FROM applications
WHERE price_overview IS NOT NULL
    AND (
        initial_price < 0 
        OR final_price < 0
        OR (discount_percent > 0 AND final_price > initial_price)
    );
```

**Result:** Zero anomalies detected, validates data integrity

### **Statistical Profiling**

**Distribution Analysis:**

- Price distributions: Normal with long tail
- Release dates: Exponential growth
- Metacritic scores: Slight positive skew
