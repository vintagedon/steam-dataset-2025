> **Session Date:** 2025-09-02  
> **Status:** Complete  
> **Scripts Produced:** 7 production scripts | 1 SQL schema | 2 analysis reports  
> **Key Innovation:** Two-pass ETL with transactional integrity for complex relational data

## Problem Statement

The project had successfully validated and enriched raw Steam API JSON data but lacked the infrastructure to enable advanced analytics, ensure referential integrity, and support future AI/ML features. A flat JSON file couldn't provide the query performance, data validation, or relational structure needed for serious research applications.

---

## Solution Overview

Built a complete database pipeline that transforms validated JSON into a normalized PostgreSQL database with pgvector support. The solution uses a two-pass ETL strategy to ensure referential integrity, wraps all operations in transactions for atomicity, and includes post-import optimization for production-grade performance.

### Configuration: `schema.sql`

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for database structure

**Key Tables:**

- `applications` - Core app data with JSONB and vector columns
- `reviews` - User reviews with author statistics (BIGINT fix applied)
- Lookup tables: `developers`, `publishers`, `genres`, `categories`
- Junction tables for many-to-many relationships

**Critical Features:**

- `vector(384)` columns for pgvector semantic search
- `JSONB` columns for flexible semi-structured data
- `ENUM` types for data consistency
- `ON DELETE CASCADE` for referential integrity
- Generated columns for combined text fields

<details>
<summary>Schema Highlights</summary>

```sql
CREATE TABLE applications (
    appid BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    type app_type,
    description_embedding vector(384),
    combined_text TEXT GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
        COALESCE(name, '') || ' ' || 
        COALESCE(short_description, '') || ' ' || 
        COALESCE(about_the_game, '')
    ) STORED,
    price_overview JSONB,
    -- 20+ additional columns
);

CREATE TABLE reviews (
    recommendationid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    appid BIGINT REFERENCES applications(appid) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    author_playtime_forever BIGINT, -- Fixed from INTEGER
    review_embedding vector(384),
    -- 15+ additional columns
);
```

</details>

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Decisions

**Multi-Modal Database Design:** Combined normalized relational core (developers, genres) with flexible JSONB storage (prices, requirements) and vector types. This provides ACID compliance, query performance, and AI readiness without compromise.

**Two-Pass ETL Strategy:** First pass extracts all unique lookup values and populates lookup tables. Second pass inserts main data using generated IDs. This guarantees referential integrity without complex dependency resolution during import.

**Transactional Atomicity:** Entire import wrapped in single transaction. If any insert fails, complete rollback leaves database clean. Critical for data integrity at scale.

### Key Implementation Patterns

1. **RAVGV Execution:** Phase 2 Generated data â†’ Script 01 Verified â†’ Script 02 Generated schema â†’ Script 03 Generated populated DB â†’ Script 04 Verified performance â†’ Script 05 Validated success

2. **Bulk Insert Optimization:** Uses `psycopg2.extras.execute_values` for batch operations, reducing network round-trips and transaction overhead by ~10x compared to row-by-row inserts

3. **Post-Import Separation:** Performance-intensive tasks (vector indexes, materialized views) deferred to separate script. Dramatically speeds initial load by avoiding index updates on every INSERT

### Technical Innovations

**Data Type Evolution Discovery:** Analysis revealed user statistics (playtime, game counts) could exceed 32-bit INTEGER limits. Schema updated to BIGINT (64-bit) preventing data truncation for power users with 10k+ hours played.

## Validation & Results

### Success Metrics

- âœ… **Import Completeness:** 8,711 applications and 36,265 reviews imported with zero data loss
- âœ… **Referential Integrity:** Zero orphaned records across all junction tables
- âœ… **Performance:** Sample import completed in 12 seconds (full 239k dataset projected ~8 minutes)
- âœ… **Vector Readiness:** HNSW indexes created successfully, semantic search operational

### Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Sample (8.7k) | Projected (239k) | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Validation | 30s | 14 min | Pre-flight checks |
| Schema Creation | <1s | <1s | DDL operations |
| Bulk Import | 12s | 8 min | Two-pass ETL |
| HNSW Indexing | 3s | 2.5 min | Vector index build |
| Analytics Gen | 5s | 3 min | Query execution |

---

## Integration Points

**File System:** Reads enriched JSON from Phase 2/3 output directory

**Database:** Creates, populates, and optimizes PostgreSQL 16 database with pgvector extension

**Output for Phase 5:** Populated `steam5k` database serves as input for sample dataset analytics validation

---

## Usage Guide

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Required packages
pip install psycopg2-binary python-dotenv tqdm

# Environment variables in .env
PG_HOST=10.25.20.8
PG_PORT=5432
PG_ADMIN_USER=postgres
PG_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<admin_password>
PG_APP_USER=steam_app
PG_APP_USER_PASSWORD=<app_password>
STEAM_API_KEY_2=<secondary_key>
```

### Running the Pipeline

**Step 1: Validate Source Data**

```bash
python3 04-01-validate-steam-data-integrity.py
# Review validation report before proceeding
```

**Step 2: Create Database and Schema**

```bash
python3 04-02-setup-postgresql-schema.py steam5k
# Confirms schema.sql applied successfully
```

**Step 3: Import Data**

```bash
python3 04-03-import-json-to-pgsql.py steam5k steam_data_sample_enriched.json
# Monitors progress with tqdm bars
```

**Step 4: Optimize for Production**

```bash
python3 04-04-post-import-database-tasks.py steam5k
# Creates indexes and materialized views
```

**Step 5: Generate Validation Report**

```bash
python3 04-05-generate-initial-analytics.py steam5k
# Outputs timestamped markdown report
```

### Verification

```bash
# Connect to database
psql -h 10.25.20.8 -U steam_app -d steam5k

# Verify record counts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM applications;  -- Should match JSON record count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM reviews;       -- Should match review count
SELECT * FROM get_database_stats(); -- Summary function
```

## Lessons Learned

### Challenges Overcome

| Challenge | Root Cause | Solution | Technical Approach |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Database creation permission denied | PostgreSQL ownership rules require role membership | Added `GRANT app_user TO admin_user` | Modified script 04-02 to grant role membership before CREATE DATABASE |
| Integer overflow on review statistics | Power users exceed 2.1B playtime seconds | Changed schema to BIGINT | Updated schema.sql, created fix discovery script |
| Slow referential integrity | Foreign key lookups during insert | Two-pass ETL strategy | First pass populates lookups, second uses cached ID maps |
| HNSW index blocking writes | CREATE INDEX locks table | Used CONCURRENTLY option | Modified script 04-04 to allow concurrent access |

### Technical Insights

**Hybrid Schema Power:** Combining normalized tables, JSONB flexibility, and vector columns proved highly effective for complex API data. Query performance excellent while preserving raw data fidelity.

**BIGINT is Safer Default:** Real-world user data (especially time-based metrics) easily exceeds INTEGER limits. BIGINT should be default for any user-generated numeric statistics.

**Post-Import Optimization Critical:** Separating data loading from index creation is not optional at scale. Index updates during bulk INSERT create exponential slowdown.

### Process Insights

**Validation Before Import:** The 30-second pre-flight validation (script 01) prevented hours of debugging by catching structural issues before database operations began.

**Transactional Safety Enables Confidence:** Knowing entire import can be rolled back on any error allowed aggressive optimization without fear of partial-state corruption.
