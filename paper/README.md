# üìÑ Academic Paper

Academic manuscript and supplementary materials for Steam Dataset 2025 research publication. This directory will contain the formal academic paper documenting the multi-modal database architecture, systematic data engineering methodology, and comprehensive analytical capabilities demonstrated by the Steam Dataset 2025 project.

## Overview

This directory is planned to house the complete academic publication package, including the main manuscript, supplementary materials, and supporting documentation for peer review and publication. The paper will present the Steam Dataset 2025 project as a comprehensive case study in modern data engineering practices, multi-modal database architecture, and systematic approach to large-scale API data collection and analysis.

The academic contribution focuses on demonstrating practical implementation of advanced database technologies for gaming industry analysis, providing a replicable methodology for similar large-scale data engineering projects, and establishing benchmarks for multi-modal analytical approaches in the gaming domain.
